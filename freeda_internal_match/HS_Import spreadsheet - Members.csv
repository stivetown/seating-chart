Amy,Towers,amy@browneandtowers.com,New York City,7,4,,I'm not feeling the best about where I am in the business,"This is difficult to answer simply. We are in the process of rebranding and a website redesign as we have a unique scenario where we are appealing to both the NY/Northeast client (about 70% of our business) as well as the Atlanta + Southeast client (about 30% of our business). We haven't had the chance to update our website and content in over 2 years so much of our more relevant (and higher end, more relevant) content isn't shown yet and we need to modernize the branding as it is very much stuck in the 5-7 years ago Old world, light and airy, European style. We're excited for this rebranding and feel it will better match us to our ideal target client. Simultaneously, we would love to increase the amount of qualified and ideal target client leads we are receiving, as we are kind of in this grey area of lovely brides vs. luxury. We need our clients to trust more and be willing to lean in more with design and ultimately budget. I would love to find ways to broaden our reach and therefore align and bring in better, more qualified, on-brand leads with higher budgets. Hand in hand with this, is being able to increase our pricing. I have fellow planner friends in NY who maybe have a catering background for example, and therefore have an influx of regular leads, and are charging $35-38K+ on the regular. Whereas, for us it is a struggle to charge in the $20-25+ range let alone on a percentage. Anyways, we would like to uplevel, be better aligned with branding and have a more steady flow of design-focused clients. Happy to speak more to this all on a call.
